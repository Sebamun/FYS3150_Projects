# Project 5

## Report

You can find the report document "Project_5_final.pdf" in the Project_5 folder.

## Code

We have used the following programming languages and packages: <br />

- C++
- Python
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Numpy

To access the code of this project go to the Project_5_Code folder. Here you will find a makefile, which will compile our c++ programmes. Use command `make all` to compile. We run the executables for task c and d in python scripts. All you have to do after you have compiled is to run our python scripts:

```terminal
Project-path username$ python3 c.py
Project-path username$ python3 d.py
 ```
 for the other parts of the project just run the executables:
```terminal
Project-path username$ ./run_2d.x
Project-path username$ ./run_g.x
 ```
 and plot using the programs
 ```terminal
Project-path username$ python3 Plot_2d.py
Project-path username$ python3 Lithosphere_plots.py
 ```
